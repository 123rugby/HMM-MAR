### HMM-MAR

Please check [https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/HMM-MAR/wiki](the Wiki) [https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/HMM-MAR/wiki](https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/HMM-MAR/wiki) for the latest documentation, including some basic introduction to the method. 

The example.m file provides some basic demonstration of the toolbox functionality. The run_HMMMAR.m is a template script that specifies some basic options depending on the specified data modality and, provided that the user has already loaded the data in the right format (see the script for details), runs the HMM-MAR and gets some basic information out of the estimation.  

For more detailed description and simulations, please refer to
